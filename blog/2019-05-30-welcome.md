Hello! And, welcome to the AusTrakka Community Page.

What I hope to do in this post is introduce some of the key concepts behind AusTrakka, and hopefully get some people excited about contributing. But, first, let's start with _why_...

:::note TLDR

AusTrakka aims at providing a solution for real-time surveillance of pathogens across jurisdictional boundaries. It is designed with security and privacy as a first class requirement to ensure wide adoption across public health labs. Public health labs are our primary users.

## Why AusTrakka?

:::important The problem

AusTrakka is meant to be a technical solution to a long standing problem in microbial public health (public health that deals with pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 and Salmonella): seamless and real-time data sharing across jurisdictional boundaries.

:::

### Background

Why is data sharing a problem in the first place? Lots of things contribute to it, but part of it is related to keeping track of what has been shared, and with differing/incompatible methods being used across PHLs to generate similar data (rendering comparisons hard).

Other issues involve distinct legislation governing what can and cannot be shared, and in what form it can be shared. This means it can become a bit bureaucratic at times to share data. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, because these are checks and balances designed to ensure privacy and confidentiality of people and businesses. These balances form the basis of the "social contract" public health labs have with the population they serve in order to engender trust.

### Genomic data to the rescue

Genomics is providing a simple type of data that is relatively easy for (most) labs to generate, and that is portable and easily comparable. In other words, genomic data produced at different labs can easily be pooled and compared.

What is even better is that this genomic data (from the pathogen) can be collected and shared in a way that contains no identifiable information about the patient or business (e.g., a food production facility). **So, in and of itself, the genomic data of a pathogen carries very little information that is useful from a public health perspective.**

It becomes a little more interesting when you compare the genome data of one pathogen to those of others that are closely related (i.e., from the same species or same sub-species, type, or strain). The goal of this comparison is to find two or more genomes that look very similar, much more similar than any of the other genomes being compared. Such high levels of similarity could be indicative of a very recent common origin which might be of public health concern (e.g., a contaminated food source).

In this sense, genomics can be used a surveillance tool to help identify potential outbreaks faster, and better focus the resources of public health officials. This is the principal of GenomeTrakr ([https://www.fda.gov/food/whole-genome-sequencing-wgs-program/genometrakr-network](https://www.fda.gov/food/whole-genome-sequencing-wgs-program/genometrakr-network "https://www.fda.gov/food/whole-genome-sequencing-wgs-program/genometrakr-network")), which is has now been made part of the broader NCBI Pathogen Detection portal ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/ "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/")).

### So, why AusTrakka?

If we already have the Pathogen Detection Portal and GenomeTrakr, why do we need AusTrakka? 

In one word, `integration`. AusTrakka aims to fill an important gap in the above projects, which is seamless integration of all the data needed to interpret the genomic information in order to reach actionable public health responses, and one-click secure sharing of data across jurisdictions when required and appropriate.

In doing so, AusTrakka wants to provide the genomic epidemiologists at Public Health Labs the tools to richly interrogate the genomic data along side the crucial epidemiological data, and produce interactive reports for public health official stakeholders.

Importantly, it provides this in a way that the genomics epi can focus on genomics epi problems without being concerned about the underlying infrastructure or the bioinformatics tooling. Although, that information is available if needed.

To provide the seamless integration, data security and privacy are paramount, and first-class, requirements.
